# E2E tests

This package contains e2e tests for rancher-turtles project. Implementation is based on e2e suite from [cluster-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/main/test).

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Required IAM permissions: <https://eksctl.io/usage/minimum-iam-policies/>

In order to correctly populate provided URL rancher requires to be configured with resolvable server-url setting. In local e2e setup this is handled with [helm based](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller#helm) installation for [ngrok-ingress](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller), using free account.

To setup a free account, the simplest way is to follow their [quickstart](https://ngrok.com/docs/using-ngrok-with/k8s/) guide, specifically steps required to populate these two environment variables:

```bash
export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=[AUTHTOKEN]
export NGROK_API_KEY=[API_KEY]
```

Then you need to configure the domain name by going into `Dashboard -> Cloud Edge -> Domains` and clicking the `New Domain` button. This will generate a random domain name for the free account. Copy the value and then store it in your environment with:

```bash
export RANCHER_HOSTNAME=<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>
```

Now you are ready to start your e2e test run.

**Note:** If you want to run vSphere e2e tests locally, please refer to the instructions provided in the [Running vSphere e2e tests locally](#running-vsphere-e2e-tests-locally) section.

### Workspace Setup

Setup the multi-module workspace, by running the following commands in the turtles root folder.  
This will generate a `turtles/go.work` file to allow linting in tests. Be aware that this may break vendoring process used for `make test` task due to incompatibility between the two.  

```bash
go work init
go work use ./test ./
```

Additionally, you will need to add `e2e` to build tags in your IDE of choice for the imports in the test suite to become resolvable.  
For example in VSCode `settings.json`:  

```json
 "go.buildTags": "e2e",
```

### Running the tests

From the project root directory:
```bash
make test-e2e
```

This will consequently:
1. Build a docker image with the current repository code using `docker-build` Makefile target.
2. Generate a test release chart containing docker image tag built in the previous step
3. Install all prerequisite dependencies, like `helm`, `kubectl>=v1.30.0`, download `cluster-api-operator` helm release file from pre-specified URL.
4. Create the test cluster, run the test suite, cleanup all test resourses.
5. Collect the [artifacts](#artifacts)

### Running vSphere e2e tests locally

#### Prerequisites

1. Initiate a VPN connection using a client such as OpenVPN or Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
1. Set up all the necessary environment variables. You can start with the [`.envrc.example`](../../.envrc.example) file and
  use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to load these variables into your shell. Rename the file and modify the values as required.
  You can obtain these values from a team common credentials shared location. Also, they can be fetched by accessing the vcenter
  URL and following the steps described on the table below:

| Name                       | Details                                                                                       | How to get

#### Running the tests

From the project root directory:

```bash
TAG=v0.0.1 GINKGO_LABEL_FILTER=local make test-e2e
```

**Important note:** The vSphere e2e tests require a VPN connection, which makes their integration into the daily e2e CI job challenging. Therefore,
team members should run these tests locally every two weeks. By this, it can ensured that the tests remain functional and up-to-date over the
time.

## Architecture

### E2E config

The config is located in `test/e2e/config/operator.yaml`.

`E2E_CONFIG` env variable is required to point to an existing path, where the config is located.

`variables` section provides the default values for all missing environment variables used by test suite with the same name.

Most notable ones:
```yaml
variables:
  RANCHER_VERSION: "v2.10.2" # Default rancher version to install
  RANCHER_HOSTNAME: "localhost" # Your ngrok domain
  NGROK_API_KEY: "" # Key and token values for establishing ingress
  NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: ""
  MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: "isolated-kind" # Environment to run the tests in: eks, isolated-kind, kind.
  TURTLES_VERSION: "v0.0.1" # Version of the turtles image to use
  TURTLES_IMAGE: "ghcr.io/rancher/turtles-e2e" # Rancher turtles image to use. It is pre-loaded from local docker registry in kind environment, but expected to be pulled and available in `eks` cluster environment
  ARTIFACTS_FOLDER: "_artifacts" # Folder for the e2e run artifacts collection with crust-gather.
  SECRET_KEYS: "NGROK_AUTHTOKEN,NGROK_API_KEY,RANCHER_HOSTNAME,RANCHER_PASSWORD,CAPA_ENCODED_CREDS,CAPG_ENCODED_CREDS,AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID,AZURE_CLIENT_ID,AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET,AZURE_TENANT_ID" # Is a list of environment variable keys, values of which would be excluded from collected artifacts data.
```

## Artifacts collection

To collect information of e2e failures we use `crust-gather` kubectl plugin installed via `krew`.

To install it outside of the e2e environment you need to [install](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/) `krew` and run `kubectl krew install crust-gather`:

```bash
(
  set -x; cd "$(mktemp -d)" &&
  OS="$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')" &&
  ARCH="$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/\(arm\)\(64\)\?.*/\1\2/' -e 's/aarch64$/arm64/')" &&
  KREW="krew-${OS}_${ARCH}" &&
  curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/releases/latest/download/${KREW}.tar.gz" &&
  tar zxvf "${KREW}.tar.gz" &&
  ./"${KREW}" install krew
)
kubectl krew install crust-gather
```

To exlude any sensitive information from the collected artifacts, set the `SECRET_KEYS` environment variable accordingly.

## Testdata

For simplicity each test case testdata is stored under `test/e2e/data`. This allows to use it with golang [embed](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) to avoid error checks and mistakes in the path resolution while loading the resources.

Import of the resources can be found in `test/e2e/helpers.go`.

## Testing

While all the tests are based on the combination of [ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) and [gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega), to simplify the process of writing tests the [komega](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest/komega) could be used. However this requires conformity to the `client.Object` inteface for all custom resources `rancher-turtles` is using.

## Cluster configuration

### Kind

[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is used to set up a cluster for e2e tests. All required components like rancher, rancher-turtles and [cluster-api-operator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-operator) (which provisions cluster-api with required providers) are installed using [helm](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) charts. This option can be enabled by setting `MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT` to `kind`. It's also required to set `NGROK_API_KEY`, `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` and `RANCHER_HOSTNAME` environment variables.

### Isolated Kind

This is similar to Kind but instead of public endpoint for Rancher, it uses the internal IP of CP node. This setup can be used to test providers are running in the same network as Rancher. This option can be enabled by setting `MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT` to `isolated-kind`.

### EKS

EKS is used to set up a cluster for e2e tests. In this setup nginx ingress will be deployed to provide a public endpoint for Rancher. This option can be enabled by setting `MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT` to `eks`.

### Customizing the cluster

To configure individual components, a series of `server-side-apply` patches are being issued. All required patch manifests are located under `test/e2e/resources/config`. Under circumstances each manifest could have a limited environment based configuration with `envsubst` (for example: setting `RANCHER_HOSTNAME` value in ingress configuration).

Import of the resources could be found in `test/e2e/helpers.go`.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are located under `./_artifacts` directory and is the default location for the stored logs from both workload and child cluster pods collected after each run.

## Cluster and resource cleanup
There are 2 environment variables used to handle cluster cleanup:
1. SKIP_RESOURCE_CLEANUP - Used to decide if management cluster, and supporting charts such as rancher turtles and gitea should be deleted or retained
2. SKIP_DELETION_TEST - Used to decide if the cluster created during test should be deleted or retained

The following table can help decide how the variables should be used:

| input.SkipDeletionTest | input.SkipCleanup | RancherTurtles & Gitea Charts | Git repo & cluster | Management Cluster |
|--------|--------|-------------------------------|--------|--------|
| true | true | no delete                     | no delete | no delete |
| true | false | delete                        | delete | delete |
| false | true | no delete                     | delete | no delete |
| false | false | delete                        | delete | delete |
